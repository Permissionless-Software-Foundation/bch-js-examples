## This repository has been deprecated

These code examples have been moved to the [psf-js-examples](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/psf-js-examples) code repository. They are maintained there. This bch-js-examples repository has been frozen and is no longer maintained.

-----

This repository contains a series of small example apps that illustrate how to
code up common use cases for a Bitcoin Cash application using
the [bch-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chris.troutner/bch-js) JavaScript
library and the [bch-api](https://fullstack.cash/documentation/) REST API, offered by
[FullStack.cash](https://fullstack.cash)

Here are two YouTube walk-through videos to help you get started:
- [Introduction to bch-js and the bch-js-examples repository](https://youtu.be/GD2i1ZUiyrk)
- [Working with the FullStack.cash JWT token](https://youtu.be/OdJOleHoSo8)

The `low-level` directory
contains low-level applications exercising a single feature of bch-js. Think of
these examples like lego blocks that can be used to build a bigger app.

The `applications` directory contains example applications like wallets, tokens,
voting, and other ideas.

For a full-blown wallet app, check out the following libraries:
- [minimal-slp-wallet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimal-slp-wallet) is a single-address wallet library that has been optimized for web apps. It's the wallet engine that powers [wallet.FullStack.cash](https://wallet.fullstack.cash).
- [slp-cli-wallet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slp-cli-wallet) is both a command-line wallet as well as an NPM
JavaScript library for providing high-level wallet functionality to your own applications. It's primarily used as a sand-box for rapid prototyping of ideas. It support [HD wallet](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch05.asciidoc#hd-wallets-bip-32bip-44) functionality.
- [psf-bch-wallet](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/psf-bch-wallet) is a single-address command line wallet used by the [PSF community](https://psfoundation.cash) to access 'freedom-enforcing' software.

## Installation
Prior to running these examples, you need to setup this code repository. In the
root directory run this commands to install the required dependencies.
```
npm install
```

These examples (and all PSF code) target the Ubuntu operating system. If you're trying to get setup on Windows, check out [this video](https://youtu.be/D6HlEqpUOvg).

## Running Examples
You can run each example script by entering its directory and executing `npm start`

## Basic BCH Wallet Functions
These basic examples in the `bch/applications/wallet` directory are used to bootstrap
a BCH wallet for use with the other examples. Recommended path:

1. [Create a wallet](bch/applications/wallet/create-wallet/create-wallet.js)
2. [Check the balance](bch/applications/wallet/check-balance/check-balance.js)
3. [Send some BCH](bch/applications/wallet/send-bch/send-bch.js)

### A note about testnet
Testnet isn't just a network for software developers. Many mining pools,
research labs, and even malicious miners, use the testnet and can disrupt the
development workflow. Most professional developers on the Bitcoin Cash network
prefer to use mainnet. They use 1000 satoshi transactions (a fraction of a penny)
to test their software, or use SLP tokens to test large transaction amounts, and thus avoid using the disruptive testnet.

FullStack.cash does not provide any testnet support. It's expensive and disruptive, and very few professional developers use it.
